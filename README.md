## Experience
**Data Science Intern**

**Cognifyz Technologies | November 2024 - December 2024**
#### [PREDICTION OF GLOBAL RESTAURANT RATINGS WITH MACHINE LEARNING](https://github.com/Jaywestty/Restuarant-rating-Capstone-Project.git)
During my internship, I worked with a dataset comprising 21 features and 9551 observations in this project, The objective was to explore, preprocess, and model the data to uncover insights and build predictive regression models.

#### Key Contributions:
- Cleaned real-world restaurant data, including handling missing values and reasoning through zero ratings.
- Visualised key insights using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and geospatial mapping with Plotly.
- Applied log transformation to address skewness and encoded categorical variables.
- Trained and evaluated regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, using Scikit-learn.
- Selected and saved the best-performing model (Random Forest, RÂ² = 95%) for future use.

**Impacts**: Delivered a predictive analytics model for restaurant ratings, showcasing skills in real-world data wrangling, EDA, and supervised learning.

  - Engineered features and removed multicollinearity to improve model robustness.
  - Implemented and compared multiple classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and CatBoost.
  - Built a robust pipeline integrating preprocessing and model training using Pipeline from Scikit-learn.
  - Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, achieving:
      - CatBoostClassifier: 93% test accuracy
      - Random Forest Classifier: 91% test accuracy
  - Visualized model performance with heatmaps and classification metrics to guide selection of the most accurate and generalizable model.
  - Saved the optimal model for deployment using pickle and deployed the model through an interactive Streamlit interface, enabling real-time predictions directly in the browser.
#### Impact:
  - Delivered a robust educational performance analysis pipeline, demonstrating expertise in data cleaning, model benchmarking, and multi-class classification techniques.

This is a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit that predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on their medical information. Users can input basic health metrics, and the app provides a real-time prediction using a trained machine learning model.

#### Key Contributions:
- Cleaned and processed the data by replacing zero-values in medical features with statistically imputed values (mean/median) based on distribution analysis.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and support feature selection for optimal model performance.
- Engineered and transformed relevant features to improve model accuracy and interpretability.
- Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression and a Random Forest Classifier (tuned via GridSearchCV).
- Evaluated models and achieved:
     - Random Forest Classifier: 80% test accuracy
     - Logistic Regression Classifier: 71% test accuracy
- Visualized model performance with heatmaps and classification metrics to guide selection of the most accurate and generalizable model.
- Serialized the best model using Pickle and deployed it on Streamlit, enabling interactive predictions from users through a web interface.

#### Impacts:
- Delivered a real-world healthcare diagnostic tool while demonstrating expertise in data cleaning, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and ML deployment.
