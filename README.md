## Experience
Data Science Intern

Cognifyz Technologies | November 2024 - December 2024
### [PREDICTION OF GLOBAL RESTAURANT RATINGS WITH MACHINE LEARNING](https://github.com/Jaywestty/Restuarant-rating-Capstone-Project.git)
- Cleaned real-world restaurant data, including handling missing values and reasoning through zero ratings.
- Visualised key insights using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and geospatial mapping with Plotly.
- Applied log transformation to address skewness and encoded categorical variables.
- Trained and evaluated regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, using Scikit-learn.
- Selected and saved the best-performing model (Random Forest, RÂ² = 95%) for future use.

**Impacts**: Delivered a predictive analytics model for restaurant ratings, showcasing skills in real-world data wrangling, EDA, and supervised learning.

## Featured Projects
### [STUDENT PERFORMANCE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING](https://github.com/Jaywestty/Student-Performance.git)

</p>
  I worked with a dataset comprising 21 features and 9,551 observations in this project. The objective was to explore, preprocess, and model the data to uncover insights and build predictive regression models.

#### Key Contributions:
  - **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Thoroughly handled missing values using pandas to ensure data quality and consistency.
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA**): Utilised matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for rich data visualisations, uncovering patterns and trends to inform the modelling process.
  - **Feature Engineering**: Applied feature engineering techniques to enhance the predictive power of the dataset.
  - **Model Development**: Built and evaluated multiple regression models, including:
      - Linear Regression
      - Decision Tree Regression
      - Random Forest Regression
  - **Model Evaluation & Selection**: Analysed the performance of each model using appropriate metrics, shared key observations on their impact, and selected the best-performing model.
  - **Model Deployment Preparation**: Saved the optimal model for future deployment or further analysis.
  
### [DIABETES PREDICTION APP WITH MACHINE LEARNING](https://github.com/Jaywestty/DIABETES-MACHINE-LEARNING-PREDICTION-APP.git)

This is a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit that predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on their medical information. Users can input basic health metrics, and the app provides a real-time prediction using a trained machine learning model.

#### Key Contributions:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Cleaned and handled missing values using pandas to ensure high-quality data inputs for modelling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA**): Employed matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to visualise distributions, correlations, and trends within the dataset, enabling data-driven insights.
- **Feature Engineering**: Engineered and transformed relevant features to improve model accuracy and interpretability.
- **Model Development**: Developed and assessed classification models, including:
      - Logistic Regression
      - Random Forest Classifier
- **Model Evaluation & Selection**: Compared models using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing algorithm.
- **Model Deployment Preparation**: Saved the optimal model for deployment using pickle and deployed the model through an interactive Streamlit interface, enabling real-time predictions directly in the browser.
