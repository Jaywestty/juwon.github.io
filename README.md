Data Science Intern

Cognifyz Technologies | November 2024 - December 2024
### [PREDICTION OF GLOBAL RESTAURANT RATINGS WITH MACHINE LEARNING](https://github.com/Jaywestty/Restuarant-rating-Capstone-Project.git)
- Cleaned real-world restaurant data, including handling missing values and reasoning through zero ratings.
- Visualised key insights using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and geospatial mapping with Plotly.
- Applied log transformation to address skewness and encoded categorical variables.
- Trained and evaluated regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, using Scikit-learn.
- Selected and saved the best-performing model (Random Forest, RÂ² = 95%) for future use.

**Impacts**: Delivered a predictive analytics model for restaurant ratings, showcasing skills in real-world data wrangling, EDA, and supervised learning.

## Featured Projects
### [STUDENT PERFORMANCE PREDICTION APP WITH MACHINE LEARNING](https://github.com/Jaywestty/Student-Performance.git)

<p align="center">

</p>
  A machine learning project that predicts student performance labels (Fair, Good, Excellent) using demographic and behavioral factors.

#### Key Contributions:
  - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing, including outlier handling, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
  - Engineered features and removed multicollinearity to improve model robustness.
  - Implemented and compared multiple classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and CatBoost.
  - Built a robust pipeline integrating preprocessing and model training using Pipeline from Scikit-learn.
  - Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, achieving:
      - CatBoostClassifier: 93% test accuracy
      - Random Forest Classifier: 91% test accuracy
  - Visualized model performance with heatmaps and classification metrics to guide selection of the most accurate and generalizable model.
  - Saved the optimal model for deployment using pickle and deployed the model through an interactive Streamlit interface, enabling real-time predictions directly in the browser.
#### Impact:
  - Delivered a robust educational performance analysis pipeline, demonstrating expertise in data cleaning, model benchmarking, and multi-class classification techniques.
  
### [DIABETES PREDICTION APP WITH MACHINE LEARNING](https://github.com/Jaywestty/DIABETES-MACHINE-LEARNING-PREDICTION-APP.git)

[ML API with Streamlit](https://jaywestty-diabetes-machine-learning-prediction-app-app-pnu8yg.streamlit.app/)

</p>
  
This is a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit that predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on their medical information. Users can input basic health metrics, and the app provides a real-time prediction using a trained machine learning model.

#### Key Contributions:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Cleaned and handled missing values using pandas to ensure high-quality data inputs for modelling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA**): Employed matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to visualise distributions, correlations, and trends within the dataset, enabling data-driven insights.
- **Feature Engineering**: Engineered and transformed relevant features to improve model accuracy and interpretability.
- **Model Development**: Developed and assessed classification models, including:
      - Logistic Regression
      - Random Forest Classifier
- **Model Evaluation & Selection**: Compared models using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing algorithm.
- **Model Deployment Preparation**: Saved the optimal model for deployment using pickle and deployed the model through an interactive Streamlit interface, enabling real-time predictions directly in the browser.
